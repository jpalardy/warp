====

Imagine if you could SSH somewhere by picking a hostname from a list.

Now you can:

![warp demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpalardy/warp/master/assets/warp.gif)

`warp` is a script that reads a file (`~/.warp`) and displays it in VIM. When
you press enter, you SSH to the hostname under the cursor.

If you select multiple lines, it opens cluster SSH (`csshX`).

Why?
----

If you have a bunch of servers you can SSH to, think about how you manage that now:

* you TYPE the hostname, maybe relying on bash completion?
* you create a BUNCH of aliases, with varying level of sophistication, based on how many hostnames?

Picking from a list solves all that.


How?
----

Create the file `~/.warp` and put one hostname per line.

Like this:

    example.com
    www@example.com
    anotherBox:2222 # with port

    # AMAZON

    -- production useast
    app10.useast1.ec2.example.com
    app11.useast1.ec2.example.com
    app12.useast1.ec2.example.com
    -- production uswest
    app10.uswest1.ec2.example.com
    app11.uswest1.ec2.example.com -- deprecated
    app12.uswest1.ec2.example.com

    # LOCAL

    tv
    router
    192.168.0.5 -- laptop

    # mosh
    mosh anotherBox
    mosh anotherBox:2222


The simplest format is one hostname per line. When you press enter, only the
first column (`awk '{print $1}'`) is taken as the hostname.

This also means, if you DON'T press enter on a line, it can be whatever
you want: it can be blank or contain comments. This can greatly help with the
visual organization of the file. I like to put headers, separators and notes all
over the file.

What happens if you press enter on a line that's not a hostname? It will try to SSH there
and it won't work ... don't do that :-)

If you visually select (shift-v) multiple lines, cluster SSH (`csshX`) will be
used to SSH to them.

Any VIM movement commands will work, this is regular VIM after all. I recommend
searching with regular expressions, but using line numbers is good too.

VIM is started with the content of `~/.warp`, but you can modify the buffer
before making a selection -- changes will NOT be saved back to `~/.warp`. This
is useful if you want to SSH to multiple hosts that are not on lines following
each other: just slice and dice the file, put the lines together, add or modify
something, select them and press enter.

An alternative file to choose hostnames from can be specified by passing the location
of the file as the first argument to the script.

What about ports or other host-specific config?
-----------------------------------------------

I think the right solution for this is the put your host-specific config in
your `$HOME/.ssh/config`:

    Host somewhere
      Hostname somewhere.com
      Port 5656
      User bob
      # etc...

The syntax is simple, it goes with your other SSH config, and it configures
your other SSH-backed commands like scp, rsync, and cluster SSH.

But you can also use `hostname:port` or even `user@hostname:port` in the warp
file if you want to keep things simple.


Warp as an executable
---------------------

Put `warp` somewhere in your $PATH. This is simple but it won't be able to
modify your history: your bash history will say `warp` without indications of
where you warped to.

See below.


Warp as a bash script
---------------------

Add `source PATH/TO/warp` in your `.bashrc`. Now you can warp: reload your
shell, type `warp`, press enter. A function was added to your shell.

`warp` will modify the history to contain the SSH command (as if you typed it)
rather than `warp`.
